        <h1>Hello!</h1>
        <p>
          I'm a second year ITM undergrad with a background in graphic design
          and printing. Watching my family work to design shirts, cards, and
          menus really inspired me to look for a way to combine my love of
          computers with my love of design. Interacting with many types of
          websites over the years also reminds me that sometimes people just
          don't make good design choices. So far I've worked on a number of 
          projects like redisigning a small business's website, creating an 
          online email form, and creating a draft site for a small theater organization.
