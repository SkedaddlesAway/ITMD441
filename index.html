        <h1>Hello!</h1>
        <h3>My name is Gabriela "Rain" Bartolo!</h3>
        <p>
          I'm a second year ITM undergrad with a background in graphic design
          and printing. Watching my family work to design shirts, cards, and
          menus really inspired me to look for a way to combine my love of
          computers with my love of design. So far I've worked on a number of 
          projects like redisigning a small business's website, creating an 
          online email form, and creating a draft site for a collegiate theater organization.
